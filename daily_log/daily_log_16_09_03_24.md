Daily Log #16
Documenting Daily Data Engineering, Goals, Blockers, and Learnings

Project: NYC Taxicab Dataset

Goals for the Day:
- Need to document scope of reporting
- create reference_ct_city and reference_ct_town tables
- Consolidate Common tables
- Breakout reference_nj_municipality table
    - reference_nj_township
    - reference_nj_city
    - reference_nj_borough
    - reference_nj_town
    - reference_nj_village

Blockers Encountered:
- All 3 states location data does not go down to the same level of granularity. e.g., Villages are present for NY state and NJ State but not for CT State.
- Had to create dim tables with suffix of state it relates to e.g., dim_villages_nj_ny
- If there is no prefix with state, then the dim table applies to all 3 states.

Summary of Progress Made:
- Created the reference_ct_city table
- Created reference_ct_town table
- Partitioned the reference_nj_municipality table into seperate dim tables
- Consolidated reference tables into specific dim tables e.g., dim_counties, dim_cities, dim_boroughs, etc


Next Steps:
- Associate each trip with a State, County, City, Borough, and Town
- Associate trips that apply to a neighborhood, township and village
- Investigate Materialized Views

General Notes:
- Need to investigate materialized views - this could be a better alternative than creating summary tables by the different dimensions.
