Daily Log #20
Documenting Daily Data Engineering, Goals, Blockers, and Learnings

Project: NYC Taxicab Dataset

Goals for the Day:
- Finalize LDEP Repository Organization
- Set up Github sub modules
-

Blockers Encountered:
- Having to lookup git commands
- Running short on time
-

Summary of Progress Made:
- Finalized LDEP repostory
- Created Repositories for daily_log, and long_form_post
- Added daily logs and long_form_post to the repository

Next Steps:
- Create repositories for media_descriptions, short_form_post, and pipeline_chronicles
- Gather and add short_form_post
- Create submodules for data_projects

General Notes:
-Creating Local Repository: 
    - mkdir my_project   # create a new directory
    - cd my_project      # navigate into the directory
    - git init (Initializes git repository in that directory)
- Create Remote Repository
    - Create Repository on Github
    - cd /path/to/my_project (navigate to directory)
    - git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git (local tracks remote?)
    - git push -u origin master - (pushes local changes to remote)
- Check Branches
    - "git branch" (Shows branches in local respository with * next to current branch)
    - git branch -r (shows branches in remote)
- Rename Branch Locally
    - git branch -m new_branch_name (If you are on the branch you want to rename)
    - git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name (If you are not on branch you want to rename)
- Delete Branch Localy
    - git branch -d branch_name (You cannot delete the default branch so if this is the case you have to change which branch is default)
