Daily Log #4
Documenting Daily Data Engineering, Goals, Blockers, and Learnings
Project: NYC Taxicab Dataset

Goal for the Day:
- Create Weekly Aggregation Tables
- Push Writings to Github
- Move Personal Projects Folder to WSL


Blockers Encountered:
- All daily summary tables  needs to have ride_count column added and currently it is only giving me the ride count for the day and not the day & the payment type or vendor type
- 
- 

Summary of Progress Made:
Created the nyctaxicab_weekly_summary, nyctaxicab_weekly_summaryby_vendor, and nyctaxicab_weekly_summarybypayment_type tables, each with a date_id column based on the week_start_date.

Next Steps:
- Re-create Dim Table SQL statements to store for future use
- Add ride_count column in daily summary tables that calculate ride_count for each day and dimension (e.g., vendor)
-

General Notes:
- When performing a Drop Column command you do not need to include the data type
- I should refactor the update SQL statements to consolidate multiple updates - looks like I will need to use JOIN statement

-- Remove Date Column
ALTER TABLE nyctaxicab_weekly_summary
DROP COLUMN year,
DROP COLUMN week_start_date,
DROP COLUMN week_end_date;
