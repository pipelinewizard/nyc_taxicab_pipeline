Daily Log #2
Documenting Daily Data Engineering, Goals, Blockers, and Learnings

Project: NYC Taxicab Dataset

Goal for the Day:
•	Finish making the appropriate aggregation tables
•	Object Storage for Raw Data
Blockers Encountered:
•	Attempted to create weekly aggregation tables and was unsuccessful. I am attempting to JOIN the “week” column into the nyctaxicab_weekly_summary table from the dim_date table using the date_id columns from both tables. The “week” column shows only null values, which doesn’t make any sense, since there are matching date_id columns in both of the columns.

Summary of Progress Made:
Attempted to create a weekly aggregation table using the JOIN function but was unsuccessful. Will continue working on this task tomorrow morning. Next steps include investigating the JOIN SQL query for the nyctaxicab_weekly_summary table and creating weekly summaries by vendor and payment type.

General Notes:
•	Parameters vs. Arguments
o	Parameters are placeholders for arguments
o	Arguments are the values for those placeholders
o	f(a,b,c) = Function signature
