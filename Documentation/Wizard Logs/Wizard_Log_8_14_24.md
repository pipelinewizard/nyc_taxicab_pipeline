Wizard Log
Date: [8_14_24]
Project: [NYC Taxicab Pipeline]

Goal for the Day:
- Re-Create DIM table SQL statements to push to Github
- Create Monthly summary tables
-

Blockers Encountered:
- Pushing to GitHub - I am not exactly sure what is happening but for some reason when I attempt to push the local repository to github it gets hung up.
- 
-

Summary of Progress Made:
- Created Monthly Summary Tables
- 
-

Next Steps:
- Need to re-create SQL queries for DIM tables - I'm being lazy (which isnt actually true, but I need to knock it out)
-
-

General Notes:
- I need to learn git commands so I dont have to rely on the user interface in vs code.
- Still not sure if creating the aggregates and kpis in the Postgresql database is the most optimal approach. After talking to some people online I am still unsure which is the best option. I will leave it for now (aggregation tables and kpi tables) have been created in the database, but once again I am unsure if this is the best approach.
