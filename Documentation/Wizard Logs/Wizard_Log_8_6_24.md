Project: [NYC Taxicab Data Pipeline]
________________________________________
Goal for the Day:
•	Define Constraints
•	Create aggregation tables
•	Organize SQL File Structure
•	Push to GitHub
Blockers Encountered:
•	[Describe any obstacles or issues faced]
Summary of Progress Made:
•	Created the following aggregation tables: nyctaxicab_daily_summary, nyctaxicab_daily_summary_byvendor, nyctaxicab_daily_summary_bypayment_type, nyctaxicab_summarybypayment_type, nyctaxicab_summary_byvendor. Also created the proper foreign key constraints for all the tables.
•	I organized the SQL File structure and pushed to github
Next Steps:
•	Next steps will be to continue making the appropriate aggregation tables that I think I will be necessary for analysis.
•	Push the data to Github

General Notes:
•	How do you decide what aggregations to add?
•	Should I put Sums and Averages on the same aggregation table?
