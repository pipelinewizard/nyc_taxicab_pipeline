Project: [NYC Taxicab Data Pipeline]
________________________________________
Goal for the Day:
•	Define Constraints
•	Create aggregation tables
•	Organize SQL File Structure
•	Push to GitHub
Blockers Encountered:
•	[Describe any obstacles or issues faced]

Summary of Progress Made:
Created and set up aggregation tables for NYCTaxiCab, including daily summaries and vendor/payment type summaries, along with the appropriate foreign key constraints. Additionally, organized the SQL file structure and pushed it to GitHub.

Next Steps:
•	Next steps will be to continue making the appropriate aggregation tables that I think I will be necessary for analysis.
•	Push the data to Github
________________________________________
General Notes:
•	How do you decide what aggregations to add?
•	Should I put Sums and Averages on the same aggregation table?
Lessons Learned:
•	[Reflect on what you learned today]
