Daily Log # 21
Documenting Daily Data Engineering, Goals, Blockers, and Learnings

Project: NYC Taxicab Dataset

Goals for the Day:
- README.md
- NYCtaxicab Data Model
- Add KPI Location Tables
- Report Scope Document

Blockers Encountered:
- No Blockers
-
-

Summary of Progress Made:
- Added Location Summary Tables (daily, weekly, monthly - all start and end state)
-
-

Next Steps:
- Add the other dimension summary tables (e.g., counties, cities, boroughs etc.)
-
-

General Notes:
- Walked through the monthly and weekly summary sql statements to gain a better understanding of the process.
- The main goal is to get the month start or week start date for each consolidated row and then get the date id for that start date
- I think we will have to refactor - because there should be a more efficient way to do this
