Documenting Daily Data Engineering, Goals, Blockers, and Learnings

Goals for the Day:
- Add the other dimension summary tables (e.g., counties, cities, boroughs etc.)
- git submodules - data_projects and learning_data_engineering_in_public
-

Blockers Encountered:
- in order to utilize sub modules you have to update the original repositories and the parent repositories as well. Extremely cumbersome
-
-

Summary of Progress Made:
- Added Summary Tables by start and end county
- Realized sub modules would not be best strategy for my use case
-

Next Steps:
- Continue adding the summary tables for location dimensions
-
-

General Notes:
- Adding a submodule to a repository - 'git submodule add <repository_url>'
- Updating the submodule to reflect changes made to original repository - 'git submodule update --remote'
